# Selfbot-MassDm-All
This is a discord bot that sends a dm everyone with an ofcourse delay option. I'm not the creater of this but I find it useful to share

To run this bot:

  1-Open the files and go to server.js
  
  2-Paste your bot token where it says "TOKEN"
  
  3-To use the bot do this ```!massdm {Your message}```
  
 There you go bot works perfectly.
